# Bamazon
## Description
A command-line based storefront using MySQL for the database and Inquirer for the Node package.
## MySQL Database Setup
In order for Bamazon to work, you will need to have [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) installed on your computer. If you don't have it installed, then just visit the [MySQL Installation Page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql). Once you have installed MySQL, copy all of the code from the file "bamazon.sql" and paste it into your MySQL database. The bamazon.sql file can be found in the bamazon folder. Running this code in MySQL will create your database and table information.
**Once you have set up the MySQL database, you can begin using the Bamazon interface.**
